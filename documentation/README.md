## Project Overview
KU-dle is a scheduling program, similar to Doodle poll. It allows User's to view upcoming events and vote on the times that they are available.

## Functionality for Normal Users
A Normal User is anyone using this program. They can view all of the events available on The Calendar gui and select what times they are available to attend. They will also be able to see how many people are available at the times open for an event. Normal Users do not have any admin privileges and therefore can not create or delete users and events.
### Logging In
>Before logging in, you will need to obtain login credentials from your administrator. If you are an administrator and need to create a user, see [Creating Users](#CreatingUser).

When you open KU-dle you will be prompted with a login screen. Enter your provided username into the box marked "Username: <Your Username>" and your password marked "Password: <Your Password>". If you enter incorrect login information you will be prompted to try again. On a successful login attempt you will be presented with The Calendar.   
### <a name="TheCalendar"><a/>The Calendar
The calendar is the main interface and contains all of the information you will need about events on selected days. The current month is displayed at the very top of the screen. If you want to navigate to a different month there are arrows on either side of the months name. Clicking the arrow on the right will take you to the next month, and the arrow to the left will take you to the previous month. Below the name is the day by day breakdown of the month. To view any events on a given day simply click on that day and the events will appear on the left side of the screen. The day selected in delineated by that day being highlighted. After selecting a day and an event you will be able to select the times that you are available.
### Voting for Events
Now that you have successfully navigated to a day and event that you want to vote on, its time to select the times that you're available. To do so first you need to select the event from the left side of the screen.
>If there are no events on the left side of the screen see [The Calendar](#TheCalendar) on how to navigate the gui.

After selecting the event you will be prompted will a list of times that the event is being held over. Simply check the times that you are available and click the "Accept Event" box and you're done. You can then either view other events to and vote on those or just log out.
