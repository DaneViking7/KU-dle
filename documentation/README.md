## Project Overview
KU-dle is a scheduling program, similar to Doodle poll. It allows User's to view upcoming events and vote on the times that they are available.

## Functionality for Normal Users
A Normal User is anyone using this program. They can view all of the events available on The Calendar gui and select what times they are available to attend. They will also be able to see how many people are available at the times open for an event. Normal Users do not have any admin privileges and therefore can not create or delete users and events.
### Logging In
>Before logging in, you will need to obtain login credentials from your administrator. If you are an administrator and need to create a user, see [Creating Users](#CreatingUser).

When you open KU-dle you will be prompted with a login screen. Enter your provided username into the box marked "Username: <Your Username>" and your password marked "Password: <Your Password>". If you enter incorrect login information you will be prompted to try again. On a successful login attempt you will be presented with The Calendar.
